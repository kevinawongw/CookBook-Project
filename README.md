## Description:
This project is a program that is made to help digitally organize recipes. The user is able to search recipes by name, time, ingredients, or meal type. As a group who loves food and are young college students with low experience with cooking, we thought this would be a very applicable program that we would actually use. The user is initially promted to select what method they would prefer to sort/filter by, then recipes would be outputted. 

## Implementation: 

We created four hash tables - recipes by name, recipes by ingredients, recipes by time, and recipes by meal. These hash tables are used depending on each sorting input. All of the hash tables included recipes, and each recipe is a struct that holds variables name, ingredients, time, difficulty, ingredients, etc.
